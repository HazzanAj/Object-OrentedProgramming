# Object-Oriented Programming Application
This project was developed with a view of developing "An Online Educational Web Application" from scratch, covering usage of Object-Oriented Programming Language in Java 11,
effeicient usage of Clean code and Design Pattern Princciples.

TOOL AND TECHNOLOGY 
Hibernate and Springboot For Backend
Angular and React For Frontend
Maven
Java 11
Postman API.

PROJECT STRUCTURE
Stage 1: Development of the Models using Design Parttern and Clean Code Principles
struture the model into classes.

CONCEPT:
In this project I want to extensively corver OOP-programming which is what Java programming Language is actually all about, I have commented this code according to clean code principles for 
proper understanding, I made use of loaded and unloaded constructures.
This project covers thorough understanding and implementation of Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Super() method, why we need it and how it should be implemented.
Finally an algorithm was developed which prompt the user from the Command Line (CLI) to input a particular data  and responded by displaying list of information based on data inputed.

NEXT PHASE PLAN
To develop Database using MySQL Database.
Perform SQL on the Data.
Use Hibernate to log the Data into the Database created.

SECOND PHASE PLAN
Create the Backend with Springboot Framework
Create the springboot MVC and Respositories and Interface Connection to the Database

THIRD PHASE PLAN
Design and Develop the project APIs with Postman API.
Create the Client User Interface (UI) with Angular Framework

FINAL PHASE 
Perform Springboot Authentication
Software Testing on the project
Host  the project on Firebase or Netlify.
